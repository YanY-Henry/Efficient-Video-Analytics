This is my [undergradute summer research internship](https://www.erg.cuhk.edu.hk/erg/SummerResearchInternship) in [CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), 2023. It is a pleasure to work at [CPII](https://www.cpii.hk), to collaborate with [Mr. Daniel CAI](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielyhcai/) and to be supervised by [Prof. Eric Chi Lik LO](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/eric-chi-lik-lo/).

This project aims to provide a natural language based, lost-and-found system from the closed-circuit television (CCTV) at the Hong Kong International Airport.

The project eventually won the 2023 Best Project Award (Top 5 of 58 undergraduate summer research internship).
